# WordHue
## Description
This project is for a word game named "WordHue" on ios and I write a program to solve it.

The solution could be improved by discarding the string that is not a prefix of a valid word. The computing complexity is too high for a board of 5x5 while the time of 4x4 is fine. In practice I did search on 4 board of 4x4 instead of a board of 5x5. It works and I got the highest score :) Have fun.
